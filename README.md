# Rate of Flights
The aim of project is to determine the most punctual airlines in US according to 2015 flight records.

# The Scenario of Project
Let’s imagine that we are at the beginning of 2016. My employer asked me to identify the most punctual domestic airlines in the US because his travel schedule will be quite busy and he does not want to wait even a minute for delays and cancellations. Thus, airlines that I detected as the most punctual ones will be preferred to buy tickets primarily.

Or let’s assume there is a famous traveller who has at least 2 flights in a day. Traveller wants to earn more miles to reduce flight costs. At the same time, he/she wants to choose airlines with the least cancellation, because traveller wants to buy tickets much earlier with less price. So he/she will be able to get large amount of miles because of flying with same airlines mostly.

# Dataset
